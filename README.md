# Greetings

Hay guys! There is a project based on the [microsoft blazor tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-6.0). Actually I've used it to check how a .NET web application could be hosted on Linux. So I don't really going to maintain the project seriously.
But if you are really bored, you are welcome to do something here.

The interesting part is a chat. It based on [this part of the tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/aspnet/core/blazor/tutorials/signalr-blazor?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio&pivots=server).

**Have fun! And may the force will be with you!**
